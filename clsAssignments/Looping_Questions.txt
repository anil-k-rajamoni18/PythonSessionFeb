3. Write a program to display all prime numbers within a range
	Note: A Prime Number is a number that cannot be made by multiplying other whole numbers. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers

	Examples:
	6 is not a prime mumber because it can be made by 2Ã—3 = 6
	37 is a prime number because no other whole numbers multiply together to make it.
	
	i/p: 
		start = 25
		end = 50
	o/p:
		Prime numbers between 25 and 50 are:
			29
			31
			37
			41
			43
			47
