###LOOPING STATEMENTS############
========================================
	process of executing set of instructions until some condition is reached.
	
	#TYPES
		for loop
			- when we know the number of iteration in advance.
			- mainly use range(start,stop,step)
			
			syntax:
				for var in sequence:
					body
			
			sequence: list tuple set dictionary str range
			- 2types:
				==>print based for loop
					- mainly used for printing or filtering
					- we don't have access to index locations.
					- we don't use range() method.
					- we can apply on list tuple set dictionary str range
				==>range based for loop
					- we use range() method 
					- we have control on indexes
					- we mainly use for filtering/updation/deletion.
					- we can apply on list tuple str range
				
		while loop
		=================
			- preferred when we don't no of iteration in advance.
			- while loop will run as long as condition is false.
			- In while loop we have to intialise and inc/dec index variable because there is no range support.
			syntax:
				index = 0
				while (condition):
					body
					index+=1
				
				i = 5
				while i>0:
					print("loops")
					i = i-1
			- Can we apply while loop on all datatypes? list , tuple , str , set , dictionary.
