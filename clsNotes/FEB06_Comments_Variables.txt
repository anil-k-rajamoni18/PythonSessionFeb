PREBUILD METHODS 
====================
print() -- displaying the output on screen/console.
ord() chr() --> for ascii values/symobol
type() -- displays the datatype of a variable/value
id() --> displays a memory address.


int() float() complex() str() bool() 
list() set() tuple() dict()

COMMENTS 
=================
- piece of text explains code
- makes code more  reable
- In Python we have two types of comments 
		#  --> single line comment
		'''  '''
		"""   """  --> multi line comment
		
VARIABLES
====================
	=> A Name assigned to memory locations/address. 
	=> It posses Variability property which changes it's value during phase of execution.
	==> In Python it's not need to declare datatype at the time of declaration.
	=> Datatype for a variable is decided at runtime by INTERPRETER based on value it's stored/assigned.
	
	syntax:
		variableName = value 
		
	=> While declaring we need to follow rules.
			- A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
			- A variable name cannot start with a number
			- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
			- Variable names are case-sensitive (firstname, Firstname, FirstName and FIRSTNAME) are different variables)
			- A variable cannot have same name as Reserved word or KEYWORD.

			INPUT
#######################################
	- In Python we have input() method for reading inp/data from user/keyboard.
	- syntax:
		variable_name = input("prompt")
		
		prompt : is optional , should be in string format 
		
	- BY DEFAULT input() read all types of data in STRING format as input.
	
	- If we want a specific type of data from user/keyboard, we have to use TYPE CASTING
	
	## TYPE CASTING
		- convertion of one datatype to another datatype.
		- using prebuild datatype methods int() float() complex() str() bool() 
		ex:
			str - int
				int(input())
			
			str - float
				float(input())
				
			str - bool
				bool(input())
				
			note: input() --> is str type
